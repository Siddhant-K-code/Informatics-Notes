  * **An idea of binary search \(silver\)**

In the first part, we discovered a way to lift up any distance from a node in a tree in merely logarithmic time. This enabled us to efficiently answer problems demanding multiple queries. Now, we are ready to take on a more challenging but related problem. 

We must efficiently compute the lowest common ancestor, or **LCA**, of two nodes. Based on just the words "lowest common ancestor,"
