# Tree DFS Traversals \(Gold\) Intro

As noted in the binary lifting intro as well, when you get to a certain point in programming contests, you will almost certainly hit problems on trees. Trees are a _very_ special type of graph in both programming contests and in the real world, so it is essential to learn their traversals. 

In silver, you learned how to traverse general graphs using DFS \(and possibly BFS\), but now we will focus on _special_ DFS traversals of a tree that can reveal key properties about their structure. 

Unfortunately, many of the resources available as of now describe poorly various traversals in one or two sentences and then provide large code blocks, prompting many people to memorize the code without actually understanding what is going on. 

The series will be roughly structured as follows:

* Part 1: Types of Tree DFS
* Part 2: Euler Tour
* Part 3: Application to Subtree Queries
* Part 4: Application to Path Queries

The overarching goal is to teach content in a stepwise manner with digestible snippets of code.
