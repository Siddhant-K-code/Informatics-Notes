# Preparing for Contests

Contests, such as USACO, that test informatics can be overwhelming, especially at first. It is essential to be ready. 

Months before:

Identify your weaknesses \(through previous contests if you have taken them, or through other problems\) and solve lots of problems. Past problems are best, but to save up for mocks, consider other resources/competitions to draw from. Read editorials and learn from your mistakes. If you learn new algorithms or data structures, ingrain them and their intuition into your memory. Build intuition based on how you apply these strategies to problems.

The few weeks before:

Take one or at most two mock contests, spaced out, simulating real conditions. These are very tiring and will take huge fractions of your day, so rest well prior. Take note of your mistakes. 

The few days before:

You need to be resting.
