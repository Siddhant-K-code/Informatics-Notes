# About Artificial Intelligence

Although programming contests are thrilling from the algorithm standpoint on the informatics scene, the programming that underlies their problems is essentially a series of straightforward commands and command blocks to process data on the spot. 

In other words, these programs have nothing but the logic you program them to execute. 

```text
// some libraries pertaining to the types of things we want to do

// a function definition
    // some commands to execute
    
// the main function
    // various function calls and commands
```

Yes, there can be very elegant data structures and algorithms, but the program merely executes what you tell it to do.

But what if we could be smarter? What if we could have the program _learn_ how to do something on its own based on some examples and then do it? This is the essence of artificial intelligence.
